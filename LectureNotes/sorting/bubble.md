we have to use n - 1 iterations and have to compare with adjacent elements and then push the larger elements to last 

for example dry run 
4 1 5 2 3 
first we compare 4 and 1 , 1 and 5 , 5 and 2 , 2 and 3 and for 4 and 1 we compare and psuh largest value to right side for ascending order ! 
even though it is sorted after that also it runs upto n - 1 iteration times
